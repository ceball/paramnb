# ParamNB

Generate ipywidgets from Parameterized objects in a Jupyter notebook.

See the demo notebook in doc/index.ipynb for examples.  A static
version of that notebook is available on 
[Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/jbednar/paramnb), 
but after looking at that it's best to try it out yourself!

You can easily install paramnb using conda:

```
conda install -c ioam paramnb
```

or pip:

```
pip install paramnb
```
